# Luano

**The all-in-one AI-powered code editor for Roblox developers.**

Luano is a desktop editor built specifically for Roblox game development. It bundles everything you need — Luau language server, Rojo, Selene, StyLua — so you can open the app and start building immediately. No setup required.

> **Status:** Early alpha. Expect rough edges.

## Getting Started

### Download

Pre-built installers are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/ltfupb/luano/releases) page.

- **Windows**: `.exe` installer
- **macOS**: `.dmg`
- **Linux**: `.AppImage`

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/ltfupb/luano.git
cd luano

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Download sidecar binaries (Rojo, Selene, StyLua, luau-lsp)
npx ts-node scripts/download-binaries.ts win   # or mac / linux

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run package:win   # or package:mac / package:linux
```

### AI Setup

Luano uses Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) for AI features:
1. Open Settings (gear icon)
2. Enter your Claude API key (`sk-ant-...`) or OpenAI API key (`sk-proj-...`)
3. Start chatting

AI is optional — the editor, LSP, Rojo, Selene, and StyLua all work without an API key.
